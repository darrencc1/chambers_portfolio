__Highlight the Questions and Tasks__

## QUESTION|TASK 1

__Write an SQL query to create a new dataframe about baseball players who attended BYU-Idaho. The new table should contain five columns: playerID, schoolID, salary, and the yearID/teamID associated with each salary. Order the table by salary (highest to lowest) and print out the table in your report.__

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np
import sqlite3

con = sqlite3.connect('lahmansbaseballdb.sqlite')
```

```{python}
#| label: Q1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
SELECT DISTINCT cp.playerID, cp.schoolID, s.Salary

LEFT join salaries AS s on s.PlayerID = cp.PlayerID

```

#| fig-cap: "My useless chart"
#| fig-align: center
# Include and execute your code here
chart = px.bar(df.head(200),

    .groupby('year')\
    .sum()\
    .reset_index()\
    .tail(10)\
    .filter(["year", "AK","AR"])

display(mydat)

```


## QUESTION|TASK 2

__This three-part question requires you to calculate batting average (number of hits divided by the number of at-bats)

Write an SQL query that provides playerID, yearID, and batting average for players with at least 1 at bat that year. Sort the table from highest batting average to lowest, and then by playerid alphabetically. Show the top 5 results in your report.

Use the same query as above, but only include players with at least 10 at bats that year. Print the top 5 results.

Now calculate the batting average for players over their entire careers (all years combined). Only include players with at least 100 at bats, and print the top 5 results.__

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
#| label: Q2
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here

sqlq = """ playerID, yearID, H, AB, , H * 100/AB *1.0 AS "Average hits %
FROM batting 
WHERE AB >= 100
GROUP BY playerID 
ORDER BY  H * 100/AB *1.0 DESC, playerID asc
"""
```

```{python}
SUM(H) / SUM(AB) * 100
FROM batting
HAVING AB >= 100 


```

## QUESTION|TASK 3
