## Elevator pitch

_paste your elevator pitch here_
_A SHORT (4-5 SENTENCES) PARAGRAPH THAT `DESCRIBES KEY INSIGHTS` TAKEN FROM METRICS IN THE PROJECT RESULTS THINK TOP OR MOST IMPORTANT RESULTS._

```{python}

url = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/star-wars-survey/StarWars.csv", encoding="ISO-8859-1", engine="python", nrows = 1).melt
#I was getting an encoding error so I specified the encoding, default is uaually UTF-8 but this data uses ISO-8859-1.
star_wars = df
print(star_wars)
```

__Highlight the Questions and Tasks__

## QUESTION|TASK 1

__Shorten the column names and clean them up for easier use with pandas. Provide a table or list that exemplifies how you fixed the names.__

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
#Shorten the Column Names. 
#USE regex not this manual input, This is 

column_mapping = {"RespondentID" : "ID",
"Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise?" : "watch_film",
"Some college or Associate degree" : "college",
"Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise?" : ""
}

# Rename columns
star_wars_short = df.rename(columns=column_mapping, inplace=True)

# Save the modified DataFrame
df.to_csv("shortened_columns.csv", index=False)



```

_include figures in chunks and discuss your findings in the figure._

```{python}


```


```{python}
#| label: Q1 table
#| code-summary: table example
#| tbl-cap: "Not much of a table"
#| tbl-cap-location: top
# Include and execute your code here
mydat = df.head(1000)\
    .groupby('year')\
    .sum()\
    .reset_index()\
    .tail(10)\
    .filter(["year", "AK","AR"])

display(mydat)

```


## QUESTION|TASK 2

__Clean and format the data so that it can be used in a machine learning model. As you format the data, you should complete each item listed below. In your final report provide example(s) of the reformatted data with a short description of the changes made.__
__Filter the dataset to respondents that have seen at least one film.__
__Create a new column that converts the age ranges to a single number. Drop the age range categorical column.__
__Create a new column that converts the education groupings to a single number. Drop the school categorical column__
__Create a new column that converts the income ranges to a single number. Drop the income range categorical column.__
__Create your target (also known as “y” or “label”) column based on the new income range column.__
__One-hot encode all remaining categorical columns.__
